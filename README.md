# GPS-Receiver

Bilkent University Industrial Design Senior Project

GPS Receiver data processing steps are created in C. Acquisition, Tracking, Navigation are built and well functioned.
In order to work, you need to feed system raw GPS signal data with no I, Q. The data should be processed through GPS antenna before project works.
In Navigation, ephemeris data is decoded and the location is found in geo coordinates.
